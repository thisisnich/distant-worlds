## Lore

Aetheris defies traditional planetary structure. Beneath its mountainous continents and deep, shifting oceans lies only empty space — a vast hollow, stretching thousands of kilometers from crust to core.

What gives it gravity, then? At the center floats a graviton core: a relic of unknown origin. Roughly the size of a city, it emits a constant gravitational field, keeping the hollow world’s shell intact.

This anomaly allows Aetheris to function as a normal planet — with climate, tectonics, and a breathable atmosphere — despite its impossible structure.

Yet, the hollowness poses a significant challenge: internal tremors and subtle rotational shifts constantly reshape the terrain. Attempts to establish long-term colonies have repeatedly failed as foundations fracture and infrastructure destabilizes.

The surface is covered in thick clouds and staggered terrain, shaped by delicate procedural forces: wind simulation, tectonic drift, and selective erosion.

Some believe Aetheris is artificial. Others say it was born from a collapsed neutron anomaly. Whatever the truth, it floats alone in space — waiting to be understood.
